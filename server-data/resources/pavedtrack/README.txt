DO NOT USE MODS IN ONLINE, YOU COULD GET BANNED AND I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE

This mod turns the Vinewood horse racing track into a nicely paved oval track complete with proper collisions. 
There's a few texture bugs here and there but there's nothing I can do to change that until there's proper map modding tools for GTA V. 

The screenshots were taken before I fixed the scattered patches of dirt around the track, it's 99% concrete now so don't worry about that.


**INSTALLATION** (I recommend using a mod folder!)

1.Using OpenIV (In edit mode!), navigate to: x64p.rpf\levels\gta5\_hills\cityhills_03\ch3_12.rpf

2. Simply drag and drop the provided files into that location and start up the game.

3. Head to the Vinewood racetrack and if you did it correctly, the track should look and behave like concrete. Have fun!
